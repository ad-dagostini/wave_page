      <h2>Interactive Wave Forecast Page</h2>
      <h3>For you which likes to play with the data</h3>
      <p>"
      Windy includes Wave Forecast from WAM/ECMWF and from WW3/GFS. Gives the information about Wind waves: Wind waves, or wind-generated waves, are surface waves that occur on the free surface of bodies of water (like oceans, seas, lakes, etc.). They result from the wind blowing over an area of water surface. Wind waves are generated by the immediate local wind â€“ which gives them the direction. After the wind ceases to blow, wind waves are called swells.

      <h3>What about wave information in a practical way?</h3>

      Windguru includes Wave Forecast from NWW3/GFS/NOAA, GWAM/ICON/DWD, and GDWPS/CMC. The forecasts are displayed in tables which show how the weather will develop on a certain location in the next few days. Sure that the wind speed and direction are the most important, but it also shows temperature, precipitation, cloud cover and waves (for ocean spots). Of course this is not the only thing you can see on this website, there are also wind archives, tide predictions, some forecast maps, "Top forecast" search, a simple forum for users... and I hope other new features will appear later.
